# Frontend Development Guide

Welcome to the **Frontend Development Guide** repository. This project is a comprehensive, hands-on guide designed to teach modern frontend web development.

## Content

This repository is organized into the following main sections:

1.  **Angular Guide (`/angular-guide/guide`)**: A complete guide to learning Angular, covering everything from fundamental concepts to advanced topics. The guide is structured in a clear, step-by-step format, with each chapter focusing on a specific topic.

2.  **Example Project (`/angular-guide/example_project`)**: A practical, real-world example application built with Angular to accompany the guide. This project demonstrates the concepts explained in the guide and serves as a reference for best practices.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either:

*   **Read the guide**: Navigate to the `/angular-guide/guide` directory and start with `01-introduction.md`.
*   **Explore the example project**: Go to the `/angular-guide/example_project/angular-example-app` directory to see the final application, run it locally, and explore the code.

This project is intended to be a living document and will be updated with more content and examples over time.
